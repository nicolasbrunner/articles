# Get a grip!

Image of Schwalbe tires leaning against wall

I have a confession to make. When it comes to tires, I’m very conservative. This is somewhat painful admitting to myself. I mean, wouldn’t we all like to be open-minded people, constantly trying out new things and welcoming change instead of fearfully clamping to the few things we know work or are at least tolerable?

*Grippy tires for the win.*

That good old Maxxis Minion DHF & DHR II combo just seems to work for me and the terrain I ride. Excellent braking traction and heaps of cornering grip are on the menu. Yes, the DHR II might not be the fastest rolling tire on the planet, but you get used to it and stop noticing.

I used to run a Maxxis Shorty on the front in the winter for a few seasons. But where I live, the mud (or should I say clay) just sticks to whatever tire and will clog your wheels faster than you can think. No matter the thread pattern. And on the harder-packed rock-littered trails that are usually fine to ride in the wet season, they felt like a pogo-stick, bouncing around like a monkey on steroids.

So my little safe space consisted of a Maxxis DHF 2.5 Maxxgrip front and DHR II 2.4 MaxxTerra rear both in EXO casing. Yep that's right, EXO casing. I weigh 76kg naked and run 1.35bar front / 1.65bar rear, no inserts. According to the wisdom of many reviews and comment sections my tires should explode just by looking at them but they just work for me. I’ve had exactly 2 pinch flats last year. Both were very much rider error and easily repairable trailside. I have tested heavier casings but I don’t feel they allow me to drop pressures significantly without becoming squirmy when pushing into corners.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve been on many different tires over the last few years. Just not on my personal bikes, where the tire would be the only variable changing. Still, I knew that I needed to get out of my comfort zone and open my mind to other tire options. 

When Schwalbe came out with their new Radial casing and all reviews were glowing in favor, I knew I needed to give them a try. So without thinking too much, I ordered a set of Schwalbe Albert Trail Pro Radial tires, Ultra Soft for the front and Soft for the rear.

There are 2 things where I’d like those tires to improve my riding experience compared to my beloved DHF/DHR. First, the grip on our wet off-camber roots is equal to zero even with MaxxGrip. Grabbing a brake when riding over such roots leads to instant disaster. So just a little more grip there would be nice.

Second, the MaxxGrip compound is very noisy. No I don’t notice it when riding down on the trail, but when accessing trails on paved roads, it is very loud. That’s a small nit-pick but some days it really bugs me.

And then, there’s maybe a third, more budget-oriented wish. I’m generally very happy with the durability of my Maxxis Minion tires. And yet, when I retire them, it’s always because the side-knobs start to deteriorate while the center knobs still look fine. If the side-knobs would hold up just a bit better, that would be a big plus.

Installation on DT Swiss XM481 rims went super-smooth. My usual routine of removing the valve cores, spraying water with a few drops of baby shampoo on the sidewalls, and then releasing the air of a pressurized tubeless pump installed both tires first try. No need to help massage the tire into position as I sometimes need to do with Maxxis tires. Nice! 

They do look a bit narrower and rounder than a DHF 2.5 once installed. The caliper confirms what you can see: Same width as a DHR II 2.4 and narrower than the a DHF 2.5. Otherwise I really like the stealth look from the side, but am not a big fan of the purple (Ultra Soft) or orange (Soft) line running around the entire tire.

I was initially planning on starting with back-to-back testing when the tires are still fresh, but curiosity took over. I aired them up to the same pressure as I would with my Maxxis tires and went on a quick 1.5h lunch-ride. A longer fireroad climb (around 500m vert) followed by a downhill along a ridge consisting of a rather flat, very technical and tight trail paved with weird rocks and off-camber roots with lots of mini-climbs inbetween. Many would not consider it flowy but it’s one of my favorites trails in winter and I often find myself sessioning a few spots to clear it all. The tires provided beautiful grip on a damp, cold (slightly above freezing) but not extremely wet trail. They also seemed to clear mud better (there is a short steep muddy section at the bottom) than my Minions. I attribute this only to the tire’s ability to deform more, since the spacing is definitely smaller than on the Minions. This was off to a promising start.

Overnight, we were “blessed” with rain and snow. Conditions were around freezing and quite damp. The type of damp where it’s impossible to wear glasses uphill, because they would start fogging instantly. Grip on smaller roots was very good for the conditions and an improvement over my Maxxis tires. However, on wet rocks it was the opposite, and I had the impression to slide more. My only reasoning to this, is that the Radial tires can deform more over small roots and allow for more contact with grippier parts of the trail (dirt). MaxxGripp rubber on the other hand seemed to be grippier than the UltraSoft rubber from Schwalbe in those slimy conditions.

I also started to notice more drag. On rides that involved more riding to the trails on roads, it definitely felt like more effort was needed to maintain a certain speed. The moment I switched back to my Maxxis tires felt like being released from a boat anchor. Quick accelerations simply felt more rewarding on them. This was less noticeable on unpaved steady fireroad climbs and even less for technical climbing, so this might be less of an issue for you. The flipside of this is, that the Schwalbe Radial tires provide exceptional grip for technical climbing.

Then finally spring knocked on the door: 10 days of perfect weather. Sunshine all day and warm enough to ride in shorts and a shirt. Perfect dirt, increased speeds and more trail options. The kind of conditions that make you feel like superman (especially after 5 months of winter riding). I took the opportunity to work less and ride more. And on both tire combinations.

In those conditions, obviously both tires performed beautifully but in different ways. The Radial tires would mute the trail more and are less fatiguing on the hands. The Maxxis tires on the other hand felt bouncier, for the better and for the worse. They are very fun when pushing out of corners or when pushing down on the handlebars to pop the front wheel. They simply rebound more and that makes for a very fun and lively feeling. Then again, the Radial tires feel more comfortable over very rocky terrain. Using the same tire pressure, they mute the terrain a lot more, vibrate less and are less fatiguing. They also provide slightly better grip and I felt I needed to pay less attention to brake modulation in the steeps. This became especially clear when doing back-to-back laps and switching between tires after each run.

*The Alberts provide excellent comfort and braking traction on a rocky and rooty trail like this one.*

Speaking of back-to-back testing I did also experiment with increasing tire pressure, since everyone seems to suggest that for Radial tires. When increasing my usual pressures by 0.25bar front and rear, grip remained excellent. However the tires lost some of their comfort and you would feel the trail more. Since I did not experience any pinch flats or tire squirming with the “lower” pressures, I went back to my usual pressures.

Now there is one area I found the Schwalbe Albert tires to be lacking: In off-camber gnar (relatively speaking) I felt more confident on the Maxxis tires. They would simply hold on better to off-camber rocks. On one of the forgotten hiking trails in my backyard, there is a section with many off-camber rocks where you then need to nose-pivot to turn downhill. This is always a move that makes me a bit nervous. I was not able to do it on the Schwalbe Albert tires.

*Side-grip on the Alberts has been underwhelming for my taste.*

Enter the Schwalbe Magic Mary. Since I was frustrated with the side-grip of the Alberts but liked them otherwise, I decided to order a Magic Mary Radial for the front and still continue to run the Albert in the rear. Finally, I was able to trust my front wheel again in off-camber sections. Tighter loamy turns without a berm made the difference between the Magic Mary and the Albert very apparent. The Magic Mary in the front was very happy when leaned over while the Albert in the rear would loose traction way earlier and brake free. Obviously having the rear loosing side-traction sooner than the front is not exactly the best feeling in the world, so I decided to switch the rear tire back to a Minion DHR II. It might grind some people's gears to have mismatching tire brands front and rear, but performance-wise it was a revelation. Improved rolling resistance, excellent side-grip front and rear and the comfort of a radial casing on the more important wheel.

Wrapping it up, this is not one of those games, where there is a clear winner. I personally feel like the Albert Radial tires are an excellent choice for beginner/intermediate riders, as they provide a lot of grip and comfort. The Magic Mary provides just a bit less comfort but offers more side-grip. It has become my new front tire of choice, especially for wet conditions. The DHF/DHR II combo feels more exciting to me when conditions are prime, roll better and provide excellent side-grip. I will continue riding them in dry conditions.

Also I feel like tire choice has become even more complex: Apart from different rubber compounds, thread patterns and casings, enter another variable: casing cord orientation. Thanks Schwalbe for making it more interesting and complex at the same time.

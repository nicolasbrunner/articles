# Nerding out on spoke count

This starts with a lovestory. Last fall I fell in love with a Scor 2030 on a non-intended test ride and impulsively decided to buy a frame. However, I was looking for some ways to shave some weight off the build. The test bike I rode had a Maxxis Dissector/Rekon tire combo that contributed to the playful nature of the 2030 but did not inspire confidence at all on steeper terrain. It was obvious to me that it needed better tires but I didn’t want the weight penalty that comes together with it.

*This Scor 2030 triggered my lust for lighter wheels.*

Until recently all my wheel builds would consist of DT Swiss XM481 rims with either 240 or 350 hubs, 32 spoke count, DT Swiss Competition spokes (2.0/1.8) and brass nipples. Using a lighter rim was off the table, so the only option at hand was to reduce spoke count, use lighter (thinner) spokes and aluminium nipples. I entered the rabbit hole and ordered DT Swiss Competition Race spokes (2.0/1.6), Sapim aluminium nipples and 28-hole rims.

Feel free to call me a weight-wheenie, but in my mind the bike industry is currently overbuilding frames. Just to give you an example, I personally dislike in-frame-storage (hate would be a strong word – though I did think about using it here) because it increases frame weight. Also it’s obviously just a marketing trick for making normal mountainbikes look like e-bikes and ultimately being able to use the same frame for both in the future. Sounds like a conspiracy theory? You're probably right on that.

Two very mediative evening sessions of wheel-building later I was contemplating a freshly built wheelset. Another two evenings of wrenching later the entire bike was assembled and ready for a first ride. It left me somewhat puzzled. The Scor 2030 climbed slower than my Transition Sentinel which had heavier wheels. Now when I say slower I mean slower by feel not by numbers (I’m in the anti-Strava camp).

How is this possible? The Scor had lighter wheels, less suspension, good climbing efficiency and was a touch lighter overall as well (although the frame of the Sentinel itself is significantly lighter).

First, let’s dig into the numbers.

| | 28 spokes wheelset | 32 spokes wheelset |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Hubs | DT Swiss 240 EXP 6-bolt | DT Swiss 240 EXP 6-bolt |
| Rim | DT Swiss XM481 29 | DT Swiss XM481 29 |
| Spokes | DT Swiss Competition Race 2.0/1.6 | DT Swiss Competition 2.0/1.8 |
| Nipples | Sapim Polyax Aluminium 2mm double square | DT Swiss Pro Lock Squorx Brass 2.0/1.5mm |
| Washers | DT Swiss | DT Swiss |
| Rim Tape | DT Swiss | DT Swiss |
| Tubeless valve | DT Swiss | DT Swiss |
| Total weight | 1880g (898g front/982g rear) | 2032g (981g front/1055g rear) |

On paper the lighter wheel should translate to easier climbing, right? Right? I mean, physics are physics. The real question however was: Would those differences be noticeable out in the woods or would they fade while riding? It was time for some comparisons and back-to-back laps with the two wheelsets.

My Transition Sentinel served as test mule (with a Thule trailer attached to transport the additional wheelset to the trail head). Both wheelsets had the same fresh tires installed (DHF/DHRII both EXO and MaxxTerra) the same tire pressure (1.45bar front / 1.75bar rear) and the same amount of tubeless sealant.

I spent two full days in the woods comparing them lap after lap. Testing conditions where wet, muddy and with very low traction. Any braking on roots would lead to instant disaster.

Let me start by saying that the most obvious difference in climbing performance happened when I removed the trailer. Now, that was a real game-changer. The different wheels? Not so much… but hang on.

I started the day with some very short laps on the middle section of a partly machine-built trail with berms and smaller jumps, switching between  wheelsets after every 5 laps. Climbing on the fireroad next to it, I was absolutely not able to tell a difference. I was a bit pissed because I thought that the climbs should be where I would feel the biggest difference. On the downhills the 32-spoke wheel was a bit more confidence inspiring when pushing into catch-berms. Less vague and more predictable is my best try at describing the difference.

Later I switched to the top section of the same trail, which is longer and completely handbuilt. Following a small canyon with natural wallrides and jumps it feels like a rollercoaster. It is more on the flowy side of things and very fun to ride. I must confess, that i was absolutely not able to tell a difference between both wheelsets. Admitting this to myself was a hard process and part of this was to question my abilities to feel differences. Testing different bikes? Sure. Different suspension setups? Absolutely. Differently built wheels? Felt kind of the same.

A good night’s sleep later my motivation was back where I needed it. The first section of trail I started sessioning was also on a fireroad climb with a faster, rougher trail than on the first day. I decided I needed to be more precise in my observations than just “general feel”. On the uphills I focused on the effort needed using the same gears in the same spots. Finally, I was able to notice differences on the uphill sections. Especially on the steeper climbing sections, the 32-spoke wheels required slightly more effort and felt a bit more like “tractoring”. Later I focused on where exactly I would feel the need to change to an easier gear. And again, I would shift down to bigger cogs slightly earlier with the 32er wheels. Now, don’t let me fool yourself: It’s not a night and day difference. When just cruising along I hardly tell a difference.

On this same section of trail (rough, fast) I also preferred the 28-spoke wheels when pointing downhill. They provided a tiny bit more grip and had slightly better vibration absorption over roots and braking bumps. At least until I discovered that my climb switch was still on. In my defense: The only occasion I use it is when carrying a trailer. With the climb switch off, those impressions on the downs became more nuanced, obviously because the suspension itself would help me with traction and bump absortion. At least I can safely say: the less suspension there is (hardtail fan camp I’m looking at you), the more you will benefit from more flexible wheels (less and thinner spokes in my case).

Later I switched to the lower trail section, also entirely hand-built with some medium-sized jumps and drops. I found the 28-spoke wheel to be a bit more eager to get airbone and to jump slightly higher with the same effort. On the flipside, the 32-spoke wheel felt better when pushing hard into corners where grip is not an issue.

*Weight matters!*

To wrap it up, you might have noticed the heavy use of words like ‘slightly’ or ‘tiny bit’. That’s how I would describe the differences - they are more nuanced than in-your-face. Especially uphill, where I was certain that they should be bigger. In that sense I failed at my initial goal of getting a snappier feeling bike for the climbs. Then again, the differences when descending were bigger than expected. The 32-spoke wheels feel a bit more precise and direct. The 28-spoke wheels on the other hand provide more traction and do a better job at filtering out vibrations. If only you could get the best of both worlds!

Up to this day I have spent many hours riding both wheelsets on different bikes and none of them ever needed any re-tensioning or significant re-truing (aside from a few broken spokes when sticks would get in the wheel). For my weight and riding style - think surgeon instead of butcher - I dont’ fear that the 28-spoke wheel will have a shorter lifespan.

Lucky to live in a small town at the foot uf the Jura mountain range in Switzerland with lots of old hiking trails and some hand-built trails right at my doorstep. I try my best at following my passions: Being a dad, working as a software developer half of the week, showing friends our beautiful mountains as a mountainbike guide in summer and coaching aspiring ski instructors in winter. I love all aspects of cycling, but my hearth will sparkle most on multi-day adventures discovering unknown alpine terrain and trails.

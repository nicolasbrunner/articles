Nobody wants to be the old-man-yelling-at-the-bike-industry. Yet, here I am, about to describe my frustration with the paths modern drivetrain manufacturers have decided to take. As an excuse for my yelling, I’ll also try to be constructive and contribute my thoughts on where I’d take a different path back in history to modify the future. And no, it’s not all about electronic shifty bits, those are only part of the equation. This is about making bikes cheaper, lighter and more robust at the same time. Sounds impossible? Well, hang on!

To give a bit of context, I seriously started mountainbiking around 2010. At that point in time, I was a student and bought a used Lapierre Spicy with a 3x Shimano drivetrain. I didn’t really care about the drivetrain, I mean it simply kind of worked. But boy oh boy have we come far since.

When Sram released their first 1x11 drivetrains, I was immediatly hooked. It made so much sense to the little engineer inside me: Reduce complexity and weight (byebye front derailleur). As a bonus, it also really improved the looks of the bike. At that point in time, I had an arrangement with the small Swiss bike manufacturer Transalpes and was quickly able to swing my leg over a test rig. I absolutely loved that drivetrain. It was reliable (I never had to adjust anything - not even cable tension), had ample range for me and was durable as fuck. The only small downside it had, was that I regularly dropped my chain. Coming from a 3x system, it was still an improvement. Over time, I owned different versions of Sram 1x drivetrains from X1 to XX1 and was very happy with all of them. So happy, that I never was really interested in the Japanese counterpart from Shimano. I rode it on various friends bikes and also liked it, but seeing how fast friends went through their chains and cassettes, I was never tempted. Yes, those higher-end Sram cassettes are eye-watering expensive, but they just never seem to wear out.

The introduction of Sram Eagle was a bit of a love-hate affair for me. As someone who didn’t want the additional range, I disliked the additional weight and the looks added by the 50-tooth dinner plate. Also, and I think more importantly, setup was a lot more finicky. You also lost some ground-clearance with the derailleur gaining in size. The real game changer however, was the narrow-wide front chainring. From now on, chain drops became a once or twice a year situation even without a chain guide. I’m sure this is more of a testament to my timid riding style and there are still people in need of a chain guide - but for me they became obsolete with Sram Eagle. 

I also hear you telling me that not needing the additional range is an elitist statement. And while I see your point, I don’t necessarily agree. Many people would be served just as well by a 400% range and going for a smaller chain ring in front.

Then Shimano reclaimed the range crown and obviously Sram wanted to respond and simply increased their dinner plate from 50 to 52 teeth. Having owned a 52 teeth cassette from Sram for a brief period of time this was really a bad move in my humble opinion. Not because of 52 teeth per se, but the jump from the 42 to the 52 tooth ring is simply too big. It never “felt” right when shifting down and I was always super-cautious to just feather the pedals when shifting.

At more or less the same time, Sram blew many minds with the launch of their first electronic drivetrain system called AXS. As a software engineer and technology interested person, I had to own one as soon as it came out. I went for the X01 version and it served a happy life on a Kona Process 153 for three years, until an unknown thief decided that it needed a new owner. It never missed a shift and worked great, with ample battery life and a comparably easy setup. I also liked the looks of ditching a cable (well two, if you also factor in wireless dropper posts). I never, never had an issue with it.

Yet, I went back to cable actuated drivetrains for my next build. Not because I disliked Eagle AXS, but because I didn’t see the point of adding complexity and cost to a perfectly fine system. 

This is a principle that is very dear to me. I spend a lot of time coaching younger software developers and this is something they often have to learn: It’s not all about making the most shiny solution for customers, but at least as much about keeping complexity low. In today’s world we complain how everything becomes more expensive and less serviceable. But at the same time we don’t really question all the tiny features that add a lot of complexity. Just to randomly name a few: Controlling your kitchen oven via mobile app, smart watches or even vacuum cleaner robots. These might all be great, but how long do you think will their lifespan be? And will you be able to repair it on your own?

So when Sram released their next generation of electronic drivetrains called Transmission, I was curious but not really interested. After having ridden it on multiple test bikes, I prefer the previous non-Transmission version due to its faster shifting. Transmission probably makes a lot of sense for e-bikes where there is more load involved while shifting, but personally I was very unimpressed.

Yet, it becomes increasingly difficult to find a complete bike without electronic shifting. Especially if you want decent brakes and suspension. And since Shimano has now also joined the electronic fanboy camp it has become nearly impossible.

From a bike manufacturer perspective, this probably makes a lot of sense. You save on assembly costs (no need to route cables or even have cable guides). But from a consumer perspective, I’m less conviced.

Keeping my bicycle as simple as possible and being able to service everything on my own is very dear to me.

With all that said, I decided to reconsider, what I really look for in a drivetrain:
* Lightweight
* Durable and robust
* Silent and no dropped chains
* Around 400% range
* Not crazy expensive (I’ll happily buy more expensive cassettes and chains if they are more durable)

*Slighly larger cog spacing on the 11-speed cassette vs Eagle cassette (hang on for my experience with a 12-speed derailleur on the 11-speed cassette.*

If weight was no concern, I’d happily buy a Shimano LinkGlide drivetrain. My partner has a cheap Cues version of it on her commuter e-bike and it’s great.

But since I do care about the weight of my drivetrain, I went with a min-max setup including different manufacturers and time periods. The heart of the drivetrain is a Sram 11-speed X01 cassette propelled by a Sram Eagle XX1 chain and matched with a narrow-wide Eagle chainring. The 11-speed cassette provides ample range for my taste while keeping the weight down. The narrow-wide Eagle chainring on the other hand helps with chain retention. Responsible for shifting is a Shimano XT 11-speed short-cage derailleur matched with a XT 11-speed Shifter. Cog spacing is identical between Shimano and Sram 11-speed cassettes (before LinkGlide), so this works great.

What I like best about this, is how easy 11-speed is to setup compared to 12-speed. It’s a lot less finicky and less likely to get hit by a rock because of it’s smaller derailleur shape.

Now, do I really notice the 100g weight difference between the 11-speed and 12-speed X01/XX1 cassette? I doubt it. But the 11-speed one can be found cheaper and looks better once installed. Finally, my rear disk brake is bigger again.

What else can I say on the riding experience? I mean it just works. Shifting is crisp and fast. It's also pleasantly silent, more so than a full Eagle setup. I asssume this is due to the shorter cage of the derailleur. Pedal kickback is also less noticeable, though that could very well be placebo playing its tricks. In the last half a year of riding it in winter conditions, it has seen zero maintenance. The chain and cassette are still mint and show almost no wear. I will say though, that I clean my chain after every ride with a cloth and re-lube it. The only small nitpick is the long shifter lever. I'd prefer it to be shorter, necessitating less thumb movement to shift down.

For a short period of time, I have even used the above 11-speed drivetrain with a Sram Eagle AXS derailleur and shifter, which has worked reasonably well. Do I recommend it? No, there was some minimal rasping on the cassette for the highest or lowest gears, but not enough for me to care too much. The bigger danger is the lack of high- and low-limit screws on the AXS derailleur, so when combined with the 11-speed cassette you better be really careful not to shift to the non-existing 12th cog.

Sure, you can also go with Madrone, Vivo or others. What they are doing seems great. It’s just really hard to swallow the price tag, when you can find an XT derailleur for the price of an iPhone charger.

Speaking of chargers, there’s obviously no battery to charge. Even though I never really cared about that part on my AXS drivetrains, it’s still a benefit, especially on week-long trips.

So, next time you shop for a drivetrain, I propose you to ask yourself the following questions:
* Can I upgrade other things first (wheels, tires, suspension, brakes, …)?
* What range do you really need? Are you really using your entire cassette? Could a smaller front ring also be a solution?
* Do you really want to spend a lot of money on a drivetrain?
* Is weight a concern for you?

I’m convinced, that the majority of us doesn’t really need an electronic drivetrain. It doesn’t even make our lives easier. So why bother with the additional complexity?

And if you happen to work for a drivetrain manufacturer and have made it this far in my old-man-yelling-at-modern-drivetrains word diarrhoea: I understand that you probably earn more with fancy electronic shifting. I’m also sure you have done your market research and know, that this is what your customers want. Just note, that there are still some dinosaurs around who like a simple and robust drivetrain that doesn’t weigh a ton. At least I’m aware of one of those dinosaurs.
